%%%%% Classes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% (class C S ML) represents a class C packed in S containing mixins ML.
% Example:
%
%  HB.mixin Record IsZmodule V := { ... }
%  HB.mixin Record Zmodule_IsLmodule (R : ringType) V of Zmodule V := { ... }
%  HB.structure Definition Lmodule R := {M of Zmodule M & Zmodule_IsLmodule R M}
%
% The class description for Lmodule would be:
%
%  class (indt «Lmodule.axioms»)                   /* The record with all mixins     */
%        (indt «Lmodule.type»)                     /* The record with sort and class */
%        (w-params.cons "R" {{ Ring.type }} P \    /* The first parameter, named "R" */
%          w-params.nil "M" {{ Type }} T \         /* The key of the structure       */
%           [...,                                  /* deps of IsZmodule.mixin        */
%            triple (indt «IsZmodule.mixin») [] T, /* a mixins with its params       */
%            triple (indt «Zmodule_IsLmodule.mixin») [P] T ]) /* another mixins      */
%
% If some mixin parameters depend on other mixins (through a canonical instance that
% can be inferred from them). Since our structure does not account for dependencies
% between mixins (the list in the end is flat), we compensate by replacing canonical
% instances by calls to `S.Pack T {{lib:elpi.hole}}`, and extending the reconstruction
% mecanism of mixins to also reinfer these holes.

(** [HB.pack] and [HB.pack_for] are tactic-in-term synthesizing a structure
    instance.
    
    In the middle of a term, in a context expecting a [Structure.type],
    you can write [HB.pack T F] to use factory [F] to equip type [T] with
    [Structure]. If [T] is already a rich type, eg [T : OtherStructure.type]
    or if [T] is a global constant with canonical structure instances attached
    to it, then this piece of info is used to infer a [Structure].

    If the context does not impose a [Structure.type] typing constraint, then
    you can use [HB.pack_for Structure.type T F].
    
    You can pass zero or more factories like [F] but they must all typecheck
    in the current context (the type is not enriched progressively).
    Structure instances are projected to their class in order to obtain a
    factory.

    Examples:

[[
    pose Fa : IsSomething T := IsSomething.Build T ...
    pose A : A.type := HB.pack T Fa.
    pose Fb : IsMore A := IsMore.Build ...
    pose B := HB.pack_for B.type T A Fb.
]]

    If [Structure.type] as parameters [P1..Pn] then you should use

(** [HB.structure] declares a packed structure.

  Syntax to declare a structure combing the axioms from [Factory1] … [FactoryN].
  The second syntax has a trailing [&] to pull in factory requirements silently.

[[
HB.structure Definition StructureName params :=
  { A of Factory1 … A & … & FactoryN … A }.
HB.structure Definition StructureName params :=
  { A of Factory1 … A & … & FactoryN … A & }.
]]

  Synthesizes:
  - [StructureName A] the type of the class that regroups all the factories
    [Factory1 … A] … [FactoryN … A].
  - [StructureName.type params] the structure type that packs together [A] and its class.
  - [StructureName.sort params] the first projection of the previous structure,
  - [StructureName.clone params T cT] a legacy repackaging function that eta expands
    the canonical [StructureName.type] of [T], using [cT] if provided.
  - [StructureName.class sT : StructureName sT] projects out the class of [sT : StructureName.type params],
  - [StructureName.copy T T' : StructureName T] returns the class of the canonical
    [StructureName.type] of [T], and gives it the type [Structure T]. It is thus
    ready to use in combination with HB.instance, as in
[[
  (* Cloning a structure from another one, given by the user *)
  HB.instance Definition _ := StructureName.copy T cT.
]]
  - [StructureName.on T : StructureName T] infers the class of the canonical
    [StructureName.type] of [T]. This is a shortcut for [StructureName.Copy T T],
    and it will succeeds if a reduction of [T] is canonically a [StructureName.type].

  Disclaimer: any function other that the ones described above, including pattern matching
    (using Gallina [match], [let] or tactics ([case], [elim], etc)) is an internal and must
    not be relied upon. Also hand-crafted [Canonical] declarations of such structures will
    break the hierarchy. Use [HB.instance] instead.

  Supported attributes:
  - [#[mathcomp]] attempts to generate a backward compatibility layer with mathcomp:
    trying to infer the right [StructureName.pack],
  - [#[arg_sort]] defines an alias [StructureName.arg_sort] for [StructureName.sort],
    and declares it as the main coercion. [StructureName.sort] is still declared as a coercion
    but the only reason is to make sure Coq does not print it.

  - [#[short(type="shortName")]] produces the abbreviation [shortName] for [Structure.type]
  - [#[short(pack="shortName")]] produces the abbreviation [shortName] for [HB.pack_for Structure.type]
  - [#[primitive]] experimental attribute to make the structure a primitive record,
