(*

  HB comes with a concept of factory, a virtual interface that is compiled
  down to the real ones.

  When the contents of a factory are just one lemma, the following trick
  may come handy.

  We define a type "link" which is convertible to a new type T but
  carries, as a dummy argument, a proof that T is linked to some known
  type xT. We can then use "link" to transfer (copy) structure instances
  across the link.

Module SlowFailure.

(* 
   When building a library it is natural to stack definitions up and reuse
   things you already have as much as possible.
   
   More often that not we want to set up abstraction barriers.
   For example one may define a mathematical concept using, say, lists and their
   operations, provide a few lemmas about the new concept, and then expect the
   user to never unfold the concept and work with lists directly.

   Abstraction barriers are not only good for clients, which are granted to work
   at the right abstraction level, but also for Coq itself, since it may be
   tricked into unfolding definitions and manipulate huge terms.

   HB.lock is a tool to easily impose abstraction barriers. It uses modules
   and module signatures to seal the body of a definition, keeping access to
   it via an equation.
