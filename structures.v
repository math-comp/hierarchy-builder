(** [HB.structure] declares a packed structure.

  Syntax to declare a structure combing the axioms from [Factory1] … [FactoryN].
  The second syntax has a trailing [&] to pull in factory requirements silently.

  <<
  HB.structure Definition StructureName params := { A of Factory1 … A & … & FactoryN … A }.
  HB.structure Definition StructureName params := { A of Factory1 … A & … & FactoryN … A & }.
  >>

  Synthesizes:
  - [StructureName A] the type of the class that regroups all the factories
    [Factory1 … A] … [FactoryN … A].
  - [StructureName.type params] the structure type that packs together [A] and its class.
  - [StructureName.sort params] the first projection of the previous structure,
  - [StructureName.clone params T cT] a legacy repackaging function that eta expands
    the canonical [StructureName.type] of [T], using [cT] if provided.
  - [StructureName.class sT : StructureName sT] outputs the class of [sT : StructureName.type params],
  - [StructureName.on T : StructureName sT] outputs the class of the canonical [StructureName.type] on [T].
  - [StructureName.Build T cT : StructureName T] outputs the class of the canonical,
    and [StructureName.type] of [cT], and give it the type [Structure]. So that it is
    ready to use in combination with HB.instance, as in
    <<
    HB.instance Definition _ := StructureName.Build T cT.
    >>

  Disclaimer: any function other that the ones described above, including pattern matching
    (using Gallina `match`, `let` or tactics (`case`, `elim`, etc)) is an internal and must
    not be relied upon. Also hand-crafted `Canonical` declarations of such structures will
    break the hierarchy. Use [HB.instance] instead.

  Attributes:
  - [#[mathcomp]] attempts to generate a backward compatibility layer with mathcomp:
    trying to infer the right [StructureName.pack],
  - [#[infer("variable")]], where [variable : pT] belongs to [params] and is a structure
    (e.g. from the hierarchy) with a coercion/canonical projection `pT >-> Sortclass`.
    It modifies the notation `StructureName.type` so as to accept [variable : Type] instead,
    and will try to infer it's [pT] by unification (using canonical structure inference),
    This is essential in [Lmodule.type R] where [R] should have type [Ring.type]
    but any [Type] which is canonically a [Ring.type] is accepted thanks to [#[infer("R")]].
  - [#[arg_sort]] defines an alias [StructureName.arg_sort] for [StructureName.sort],
    and declares it as the main coercion. [StructureName.sort] is still declared as a coercion
    but the only reason is to make sure Coq does not print it.
